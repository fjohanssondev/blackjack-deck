## Introduction

Start by bootstraping a new React application. You may create your application however you want. We will provide an example with NextJS below:

```bash tab="npm"
npx create next-app@latest blackjack-app --yes
```
```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create next-app@latest blackjack-app --yes
```
```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create next-app@latest blackjack-app --yes
```
```bash tab="bun"
bun create next-app@latest blackjack-app --yes
```

## Setup libraries

Once the installation of your app is done, we can proceed to install the required libraries.

```bash tab="npm"
cd blackjack-app
npm install @blackjack-deck/core @blackjack-deck/react @blackjack-deck/icons
```
```bash tab="pnpm"
cd blackjack-app
pnpm install @blackjack-deck/core @blackjack-deck/react @blackjack-deck/icons
```
```bash tab="yarn"
cd blackjack-app
yarn install @blackjack-deck/core @blackjack-deck/react @blackjack-deck/icons
```
```bash tab="bun"
cd blackjack-app
bun install @blackjack-deck/core @blackjack-deck/react @blackjack-deck/icons
```

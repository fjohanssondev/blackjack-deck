## Introduction

Blackjack-deck is a **comprehensive TypeScript library** for building blackjack games and card-based applications. It provides everything you need from core game logic to beautiful React components.

Blackjack-deck consists of different packages:

- **@blackjack-deck/core** - Game logic, hand evaluation, and utilities
- **@blackjack-deck/icons** - Card suit icons with multiple variants
- **@blackjack-deck/react** - Headless React components _(coming soon)_

### Terminology

**Headless Components:** Unstyled, accessible components that provide logic and structure without enforcing visual design.

**Tree-shaking:** Modern bundlers only include the code you actually import, keeping bundle sizes small.

**TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that provides excellent developer experience and type safety.

Some basic knowledge of React.js and TypeScript would be useful for building card games.

## Installation

Install the packages you need:
```bash tab="npm"
# Core game logic
npm install @blackjack-deck/core

# Icon components
npm install @blackjack-deck/icons

# Or both
npm install @blackjack-deck/core @blackjack-deck/icons
```
```bash tab="pnpm"
# Core game logic
pnpm add @blackjack-deck/core

# Icon components
pnpm add @blackjack-deck/icons

# Or both
pnpm add @blackjack-deck/core @blackjack-deck/icons
```
```bash tab="yarn"
# Core game logic
yarn add @blackjack-deck/core

# Icon components
yarn add @blackjack-deck/icons

# Or both
yarn add @blackjack-deck/core @blackjack-deck/icons
```
```bash tab="bun"
# Core game logic
bun add @blackjack-deck/core

# Icon components
bun add @blackjack-deck/icons

# Or both
bun add @blackjack-deck/core @blackjack-deck/icons
```

## Quick Examples

### Core - Game Logic
```typescript
import { createDeck, shuffle, calculateHandValue, isBlackjack } from '@blackjack-deck/core';

// Create and shuffle a deck
const deck = shuffle(createDeck());

// Evaluate a hand
const playerHand = [
  { suit: 'spades', rank: 'A' },
  { suit: 'hearts', rank: 'K' }
];

console.log(calculateHandValue(playerHand)); // 21
console.log(isBlackjack(playerHand)); // true
```

### Icons - Card Suits
```typescript
import { Spades, Hearts } from '@blackjack-deck/icons/outline';
import { Diamonds, Clubs } from '@blackjack-deck/icons/filled';

function MyCard() {
  return (
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <Spades className="w-6 h-6 text-black" />
      <Hearts className="w-6 h-6 text-red-500" />
      <Diamonds className="w-6 h-6 text-red-500" />
      <Clubs className="w-6 h-6 text-black" />
    </div>
  );
}
```
